# NoRussian Replit Edition
### Volunteer DDoS tool via HTML + JS + Python
Running the HTML locally on your device will create a distributed DDoS attack on Russian websites, through complete volunteering.
* Initially while that's good and all, I prefer to enhance other services. Such as Replit.com, with it you can easily create unlimited numbers of REPL and initiate a DDoS attack without any worries.

Feel free to fork my Repl https://replit.com/@safasfa23nt/NoRussian-REPL, just in case you get errors with repl.it telling you there's no Chromium browser installed.

Other browsers:
Feel free to make a code commit.
